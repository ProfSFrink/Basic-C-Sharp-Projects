The graded assignment for this course, a price-quote application where we give a price-quote for an package that the user wishes to deliver, the user must provide the weight, height, width and length of the package then we will calulate the cost to ship the package. If the package either weighs more than a certian amount or is bigger than a certain size we must decline to give a quote and end the program at that point. If the package is ok we calculate a price to ship the package in pounds sterling and then thank the user before exiting the application.

## 21 - CHALLENGE 12A-1 - SWITCH STATEMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge_12A-1/Challenge_12A-1/Program.cs)

## C# AND .NET FRAMEWORK - PART 2

## 01 - TUTORIAL: ARRAYS AND LISTS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ArraysAndLists/ArraysAndLists/Program.cs)
A tutorial video covering arrays and lists within C#. Firstly we cover how to instantiate an array and fill it with values before creating a second array and filling it with values upon instantiation, then outputing elements of the array to the console. The second part of the tutorial covers lists and how to create one, then adding and removing elements along with outputting to the display.

## 02 - ARRAYS ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ArraysAssign/ArraysAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment were we have to complete four different goals, firstly to create a one-dimensional array of strings then request an index number from the user and display the content of that index within our array, then do the same thing but with an array of integer values instead, then create a list of string values and again ask the user to select an index value and display the value at that position. For all three data structures we have a do while loop along side both if and else statements which check the value the user has entered and if it is outside the range of the array or list we inform the user and then ask them to enter a valid index number, this process repeats until the user enters a valid index position.

## 03 - TUTORIAL: ITERATION [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Iteration/Iteration/Program.cs)
A tutorial video covering the use of iteration within C#. We firstly iterate through an array of numbers utilising a for loop and output any values that are greater than 85 to the console, then we iterate through an array of strings and output any names which equal Jesse, we then also iterate throught the same array printing each value as we go. Then we move on to iterating through list and for the first time making use of a foreach loop to again check for any passing score greater than 85, then after repeating this with a list of strings we iterate through one list while add any values that meet certain condition to a second list before counting that lists number of elements and outputting that value to the console.

## 04 - CONSOLE APPLICATION ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ConAppAssign/ConAppAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment to demonstrate an understanding of iteration utilising both arrays and lists. Part 1 has us creating an array of strings, then requesting user input and then updating each element within the array with a concatenation of the value in that index plus the userr input, we then output each element in the updated array to the console. Then for the second part of the assignment we create an infinite while loop then demonstrate how to fix it, then for the third part of the assignment we have a for loop that make use of the less than operator and then a do while loop using the less or equal than operator, for the fourth part we create a list of unique string variables and ask the user to input a search string, we then search the list for the search string and output the index of the position with a match and then use the break command to end the loop, also if there is no match in the list we inform the user. Then for the fifth part of the assignment we create a second list with two duplicate entries and return the index position for both matching entries and again inform the user if there is no match. The final part of the assignment again has a list with duplicate entries but this time we have a second empty list which we add each item from the first list too, then when we find an entry that has already been added to this list we know we have a duplicate entry and inform the user of this fact.

## 05 - TUTORIAL: EXCEPTION HANDLING [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ExceptionHandling/ExceptionHandling/Program.cs)
A two-part tutorial video series covering exception handling within C#. We demonstrate this technique by requesting the user input two integer values and dividing them by two, if the user enters a letter instead of a number a catch block will run and give the user an error message. In the second part of the tutorial we catch DivideByZeroExceptions to catch if the user attempts to divide a number by zero and then general exception to catch any other type of error, then we cover the finally statement to ensure certain code always run no matter what.

## 06 - EXCEPTION ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ExceptionAssign/ExceptionAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment where we generate a list of six random integers between 1 and 100 then ask the user to enter a whole number we then divide each number in the list by the number the user has entered and output each to the console. Initally there was no try / catch block implemented and within the code comments I have logged the number generate by the application, my input as the user and the error message visual studio gave, this can ben seen after the program source code. Then we implement the code with in a try / catch block along with a finally block, the catch block catches both FormatExceptions and DivideByZeroExceptions along with outputting appropriate error messages and the finally block executes to inform the user that normal program execution has resumed.

## 07 - TUTORIAL: CLASSES AND OBJECTS - TWENTY-ONE (BLACKJACK CARD GAME) [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne/Program.cs)
A tutorial series covering how classes and objects work within C#, this tutorial works differently to the other ones as we will develop a game as we go along, which will be a blackjack game. The first thing we do create a new class definition to represent a playing card and give it two properties Suit and Face as these are all we need to represent a playing card within a program. Then in the second part of the series we create a Deck object which is a list of the card objects that we created, we can then use a constructor to create a full deck of cards for us everytime we create an instance of the Deck object. For the third part of the tutorial we update the deck objects constructor to create one list of strings to represent the suits in a deck of cards and a second list of strings to represent the faces in a deck of cards, we then use nested foreach loops to create a full deck of 52 cards, this will happen each time we instanstiate a new instance of the deck object. Then iterate through each element of the deck object and output it to the console to ensure the deck has been created.

## 08 - TUTORIAL: METHODS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne/Program.cs)
Carrying on with our blackjack game from the objects and classes tutorial, this next part covers methods within C#. We create a method which takes an instance of the deck object then one-by-one at random takes a card from the deck and moves it to another deck, then once the original is empty it is updated with the tempoary shuffled deck, this new deck is then returned to the main program and outputted to the console to show that it has been shuffled.

## 09 - METHOD ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/MethodAssign/MethodAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment to demonstrate our understanding of how classes and methods work in C#. We first create a seperate class and implement three methods, one to simply multiply a number by ten, one to calculate the square root and finally one that multiplies a number by 125 then divides the result of that by 2. We then take a number as user input and apply the above 3 methods to it and output the results to the console.

## 10 - TUTORIAL: MORE ON METHODS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne/Program.cs)
Again continuing with our blackjack game, in this video we want to add the ability to shuffle more than once and we go through a number of methods to achieve this including method overloading which involves having multiple methods that have the same name but are slightly different, then we improve our inital shuffle method in two ways, firstly by adding in an optional parameter to control the number of times the deck is shuffled, then we add an output parameter to the method so that we can track and show to the user the number of times the deck was successfully shuffled.

## 11 - CLASSES AND METHODS ASSIGNMENT 1 [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Class_Meth_Ass_1/Class_Meth_Ass_1/Program.cs)
This is an assignment to demonstrate our understanding of classes and methods, we create a class and add three methods all with the same name, each takes a different type of input an integer, decimal and string variable respectably we then in all three methods return an integer back to the main program and output the result to the console. The purpose of this assignment is to show an understaning of method overloading within C#.

## 11 - CLASSES AND METHODS ASSIGNMENT 2 [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Class_Meth_Ass_2/Class_Meth_Ass_2/Program.cs)
For this assignment we make use of optional parameters for custom methods, we again create a class and add a method that takes two inputs one of which is an optional parameter which defaults to one if no value is passed in, a math operation is then performed on these inputs and the result is then returned to the main program. To account for the user not entering a second input we use the string method IsNullOrEmpty which checks if a string variable is empty (null) or not, we then know if we need to pass in our optional parameter or not, then with either outcome we output the result to the console.

## 12 - CLASSES AND METHODS ASSIGNMENT 3 [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Class_Meth_Ass_3/Class_Meth_Ass_3/Program.cs)
The final assignment on classes and methods main difference is to code a method that is void (does not return a value) and to execute the method but naming the parameters by name when executing the method in question.

## 13 - TUTORIAL: CLASS METHOD [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne/Program.cs)
An explanation of class methods which cover method attached to classes (objects), to demonstrate this we move the shuffle method from the main program to the deck class and then update the shuffle method so that it can operate on an instance of itself, this includes removing the static keyword so the method can operate on an instance of itself, adding the void keyword as we no longer need to return anything, losing the deck input parameter and the output parameter, then updating the main program to reflect these changes.

## 14 CLASS METHOD ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ClassMethodAssign/ClassMethodAssign/Program.cs)
A simple assignment to show understanding of the above tutorial, we create a static voided method with one input and one output integer parameter, which simply divides a number by 2 and outputs the result via a parameter instead of returning it, we also create an overloaded version of this method with an optional parameter to multiply the answer by an amount provided by the user, this defaults to one if nothing is provided.

## 15 TUTORIAL: INHERITANCE [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne)
A two-part video tutorial covering how inheritance works in regards to object-orientated programming by implementing it within our blackjack game, we add a game class to the application, this is a basic game class that only contains properties and methods which all card games would have in common, so that down the line if we wanted to create other card games they could inherit this generic game class. Then in the second part of the tutorial we create another class called TwentyOneGame which inherits the Game class, we successfully test that inheritance is working by running the ListPlayers method which it is now inheriting from the Game Class (This is called a Superclass method), we finally implement a Play method in the TwentyOneGame class, we do not implement this for now but do throw a NotImplementedException if this is run by mistake.

## 16 INHERITANCE ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/InheritanceAssign/InheritanceAssign)
Following on from the inheriance tutorial, a simple assignment to show our understanding of inheritance. We first create a Person class which has string properties for the person's first and last name along with a method to output their full name to the console. Then we create a second class which is called Employee which inherits the Person class and has one property Id an integer value. We then instantiate an instant of the Employee class within the main program and assign values to the FirstName and LastName properties, then to test that the inheritance is working we execute the superclass method SayName which is inherited from the Person class.

## 17 TUTORIAL: POLYMORPHISM [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne)
This tutorial covers the second pillar of object-orientated programming, Polymorphism which allows the properties / methods of a class to morph into another, we cover this by creating a new instance of the TwentyOneGame class which we then morph into an instance of the game class, this is a simple example of what Polymorphism is. Then we move on to some house cleaning for our Twenty-One game, firstly by adding in a Player class, with properties to represent the player's hand of cards, current balance, their name and to track if they are currently playing or not. Then we add a Dealer class to the application with properties for their name, deck of cards and current balance, then we add a method to deal a card to the dealers playing Hand, this is done by passing in a list of Card objects to represent the Dealer's hand, we then take the first card from the deck of cards and add it to the dealer's deck before removing it from the deck of cards.

## 18 TUTORIAL: ABSTRACT CLASSES [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne)
An tutorial coverting Abstract classes, abstract methods and virtual methods. An abstract class is one in which we can never instantiate an instance of but we can inherit it, so we make the Game class in our Twenty-One game an abstract class, we also add an abstract method to this class called Play() which has to be implemented by any class that inherits the Game Class, then we implement a virtual method by converting the ListPlayers() method of the Game class to one, this one already has an implementation but by using the override keyword in a inheriting class we can override the base implmentation and do a new one in any class that inherits the Game class. Then to finish we create an instance of the TwentyOneGame class in the main program, add three players and using the ListPlayers() method, output those names to the console.

## 19 ABSTRACT CLASSES ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Abstract_Classes_Assign/Abstract_Classes_Assign)
A simple assignment to show our understanding of abstract classes, like the inheritance assignment we first create a person class, with properties for first and last name but this time the class is an abstract class, we also add a SayName() method which is also abstract so is not implemented here. Then we create an Employee class which inherits from the Person class, then here we implement the sayName() method through use of the override keyword.

## 20 TUTORIAL: INTERFACES [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne)
A brief tutorial covering interfaces in C# and the .NET Framework. We add an interface to our Twenty-One game called IWalkAway then we add a method called WalkAway to the interface, as interfaces work very similarly to abstract classes we do not have to implement the method here. We inherit the IWalkAway interface into the TwentyOneGame class and implement the method there.

## 21 INTERFACES ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Interfaces_Assign/Interfaces_Assign)
An assignment to cover our understanding of intefaces in the .NET framework. We first create an interface called IQuittable and create an abstract method called Quit(), we then reuse the Person and Employee classes from the Abstract Classes assignment but the Employee class in addition to inheriting the Person class also inherits the IQuittable interface and implements the Quit() method which outputs a simple message to the console. Then within the main program we utilise polymorphism to create an instance of our interface IQuittable but create it using our Employee class.

## 22 TUTORIAL: DEBUGGING [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne)
A brief tutorial covering how to use the debug tools within Visual Studio, mainly covering breakpoints, then the step-in and step-over functions and how to make use of these tools to track variables and conditional and branching statements.

## 23 TUTORIAL: GENERICS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOne)
An overview in regards to generics in programming which covers the concept of making a class or method generic in it's design as this lends more towards being able to reuse the code in future. We then make some tempoary changes to the program by adjusting the Player class so that we can pass in the T parameter, we then adjust the Hand property to change the data type of the Hand list object to be whatever parameter is passed in via the T parameter, this in turn makes the Player class more generic allowing it to be more easily reused in other game types other than just card games. We then switch the program back to how it was after this is done.
