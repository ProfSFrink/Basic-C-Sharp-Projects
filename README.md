## 14 - BOOLEAN LOGIC ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/CarInsurAppAssign/CarInsurAppAssign/Program.cs)
A simple assignment in which we take three inputs from the user, their age, if they have ever had a dui and how many speeding tickets they have had and use these to determine if the user qualifies for car insurance. We then output the result of this boolean logic check to the console window as part of a string.

## 15 - CHALLENGE 10A-1 - IF / ELSE / ELSE IF STATEMENTS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge_10A-1/Challenge10A-1/Program.cs)

## 20 - PRICE-QUOTE ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Price-Quote_App/Price-Quote_App_Assign/Program.cs)
The graded assignment for this course, a price-quote application where we give a price-quote for an package that the user wishes to deliver, the user must provide the weight, height, width and length of the package then we will calulate the cost to ship the package. If the package either weighs more than a certian amount or is bigger than a certain size we must decline to give a quote and end the program at that point. If the package is ok we calculate a price to ship the package in pounds sterling and then thank the user before exiting the application.

## 21 - CHALLENGE 12A-1 - SWITCH STATEMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge_12A-1/Challenge_12A-1/Program.cs)
An example use of the switch statement within C#. We prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 5 and then execute a switch statement on the user input, executing one of five case statements to recommend a game to the user, their is also a default case if the user does not enter a number between 1 and 5.

## 22 - LOOPS TUTORIAL [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Loops/Loops/Program.cs)
A tutorial code along which covers loops in C#, we review the switch statement then cover WHILE loops and an example of using a DO WHILE loop in conjunction with a switch statement were we ask the user to guess a number and the program loops until the user guesses correctly.

## 23 - LOOPS ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/LoopsAssign/LoopsAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment to demonstrate an understanding of "while" and "do while" loops in C# using boolean comparison to control the loops in question.

## 24 - STRING ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/StringAssign/StringAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment utilising string functions. First an example of concatenating three strings together, then using the ToUpper() method to convert a string to upper case and using a StringBuilder object to create a paragraph within a string but by adding one sentence at a time using the append method.

## C# AND .NET FRAMEWORK - PART 2

## 01 - ARRAYS AND LISTS TUTORIAL [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ArraysAndLists/ArraysAndLists/Program.cs)
A tutorial video covering arrays and lists within C#. Firstly we cover how to instantiate an array and fill it with values before creating a second array and filling it with values upon instantiation, then outputing elements of the array to the console. The second part of the tutorial covers lists and how to create one, then adding and removing elements along with outputting to the display.

## 02 - ARRAYS ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ArraysAssign/ArraysAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment were we have to complete four different goals, firstly to create a one-dimensional array of strings then request an index number from the user and display the content of that index within our array, then do the same thing but with an array of integer values instead, then create a list of string values and again ask the user to select an index value and display the value at that position. For all three data structures we have a do while loop along side both if and else statements which check the value the user has entered and if it is outside the range of the array or list we inform the user and then ask them to enter a valid index number, this process repeats until the user enters a valid index position.

## 03 - ITERATION TUTORIAL [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Iteration/Iteration/Program.cs)
A tutorial video covering the use of iteration within C#. We firstly iterate through an array of numbers utilising a for loop and output any values that are greater than 85 to the console, then we iterate through an array of strings and output any names which equal Jesse, we then also iterate throught the same array printing each value as we go. Then we move on to iterating through list and for the first time making use of a foreach loop to again check for any passing score greater than 85, then after repeating this with a list of strings we iterate through one list while add any values that meet certain condition to a second list before counting that lists number of elements and outputting that value to the console.

## 04 - CONSOLE APPLICATION ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ConAppAssign/ConAppAssign/Program.cs)
An assignment to demonstrate an understanding of iteration utilising both arrays and lists. Part 1 has us creating an array of strings, then requesting user input and then updating each element within the array with a concatenation of the value in that index plus the userr input, we then output each element in the updated array to the console. Then for the second part of the assignment we create an infinite while loop then demonstrate how to fix it, then for the third part of the assignment we have a for loop that make use of the less than operator and then a do while loop using the less or equal than operator, for the fourth part we create a list of unique string variables and ask the user to input a search string, we then search the list for the search string and output the index of the position with a match and then use the break command to end the loop, also if there is no match in the list we inform the user. Then for the fifth part of the assignment we create a second list with two duplicate entries and return the index position for both matching entries and again inform the user if there is no match. The final part of the assignment again has a list with duplicate entries but this time we have a second empty list which we add each item from the first list too, then when we find an entry that has already been added to this list we know we have a duplicate entry and inform the user of this fact.

## 05 - EXCEPTION HANDLING [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/ExceptionHandling/ExceptionHandling/Program.cs)
A two-part tutorial video series covering exception handling within C#. We demonstrate this technique by requesting the user input two integer values and dividing them by two, if the user enters a letter instead of a number a catch block will run and give the user an error message.
