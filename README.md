# Basic C Sharp Projects
This repository is for the C# and .NET Framework Course that is part of my Advanced Software and Web Developer Diploma with Pitman Training / The Tech Academy. This repository is for basic C# projects done on the course.

## 01 - COMPILER ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Compiler%20Assignment)
This was a simple assignment to add the C# compiler location to the Windows Environment Variable 'PATH' then through use of the command line create both an executable (.exe file) and a library (.dll file) of the code within 'SampleApplication.cs' which prints "Hello, World" to the console.
