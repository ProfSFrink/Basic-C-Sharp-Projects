# Basic C Sharp Projects
This repository is for the C# and .NET Framework Course that is part of my Advanced Software and Web Developer Diploma with Pitman Training / The Tech Academy. This repository is for basic C# projects done on the course.

## 01 - COMPILER ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Compiler%20Assignment/SampleApplication.cs)
This was a simple assignment to add the C# compiler location to the Windows Environment Variable 'PATH' then through use of the command line create both an executable (.exe file) and a library (.dll file) of the code within 'SampleApplication.cs' which prints "Hello, World" to the console.

## 02 - VISUAL STUDIO ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/myConsoleProject/myConsoleProject.cs/Program.cs)
This assignment was to write a basic console application within Visual Studio using C#. The application ask the user to input there name, which is then displayed to the user before the user presses enter to quit the application.

## 03 - HELLO, WORLD! TUTORIAL VIDEO SERIES [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Hello%20World%20Tutorial/program.cs)
A code along project following an instructor to show further understanding of using the C# compiler and creating basic console applications using Visual Studio.

## 04 - CHALLENGE 4B-1 - ESCAPE SEQUENCES [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge_4B-1/Challenge_4B-1_Escape_Sequence/Program.cs)
A very simple console app which prints my name in double-quotes through use of the backslash (\) escape character.

## 05 - BASIC C# SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT - WELCOME SCREEN [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Basic_CSharp_Submission_Assignment/AccountingWelcome/AccountingWelcome/Program.cs)
A console app welcoming the user to 'Acme Accounting Systems' and prints the second line of text with "accounting" in double-quotes using the backslash (\) escape character.

## 06 - VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Variables%20and%20Data%20Types%20Tutorial/VariablesAndDataTypes/VariablesAndDataTypes/Program.cs)
A follow on video series that goes through the various C# data types and how to assign variables and output them along with examples of how to cast them into other data types.

## 07 - DAILY REPORT ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Daily_Report/DailyReport/DailyReportSubmissionAssignment/Program.cs)
A simple console application that asks the user to answer some questions then we store the inputs in appropriate data types, casting when necessary, then at the end of the application we output all the inputs before exiting the application.

## 08 - CHALLENGE 7B-1 - MATH OPERATIONS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge_7B-1/Challenge_7B-1_Math/Program.cs)
The goals for this challenge were to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers and display the output in addition to this I also completed an operations calulating the remainder of two number through use of the modules operator, also added introduction and exit messages to the application.

## 09 - CHALLENGE 7B-2 - STRING CONCATENATION [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge_7B-2/Challenge_7B-2_Str_Concat/Program.cs)
A simple challege were we are required to perform a math operation (string concatenation) on a string, three variables are declared each concatenated with a label and displayed on screen, then finally the three strings are concatenated together again with their own label and again outputted to the display.

## 10 - MATH AND COMPARISON OPERATORS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Math_Comparsion_Op/MathAndComparsionOperators/Program.cs)
A code along project done alongside a two-part video series initally reviewing C# math operators. Then in the second part of the series we go over the standard comparison operators within C# we cover less than, greater than, equal to and not equal to.

## 11 - MATH OPERATION ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/MathOpAssign/MathOpAssignment/Program.cs)
A submission assignment to test my knowledge of math operators, includes examples of addition, subtraction, multiplacation, divison, modulus (remainder) and greater than operations.

## 12 - INCOME COMPARISON ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/IncomeComparisonAssign/IncomeComparison/Program.cs)
An anonymous income comparison program, which takes the hourly rate and weekly hours worked of two people, works out their annual wage and then performs a boolean operation showing if Person 1 earns more than Person 2.

## 13 - BOOLEAN LOGIC TUTORIAL [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/BooleanLogic/BooleanLogic/Program.cs)
A follow on video covering boolean logic operators so AND (&&), OR (||), EQUALS (==), NOT EQUALS (!=), and XOR (^) with simple code examples.

## 14 - BOOLEAN LOGIC ASSIGNMENT [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/CarInsurAppAssign/CarInsurAppAssign/Program.cs)
A simple assignment in which we take three inputs from the user, their age, if they have ever had a dui and how many speeding tickets they have had and use these to determine if the user qualifies for car insurance. We then output the result of this boolean logic check to the console window as part of a string.

## 15 - CHALLENGE 10A-1 - IF / ELSE / ELSE IF STATEMENTS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge10A-1/Challenge10A-1/Program.cs)
A demonstration of the use of IF / ELSE and ELSE IF statements within C#, taking input from the user and using it to execute branching statements.

## 16 - CHALLENGE 10B-1 - NOT EQUALS (!=) OPERATOR [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge10B-1/Challenge10B-1/Program.cs)
A demonstration of the use of the NOT EQUALS operator (!=) within C#, again taking user input and using it to execute branching statements.

## 17 - CHALLENGE 10B-2 - GREATER OR LESS THAN OPERATORS [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Challenge10B-2/Challenge10B-2/Program.cs)
A challenge to show that I understand how to use both the greater than and less than or equal to operator, this is shown alongside the use of IF statements.
